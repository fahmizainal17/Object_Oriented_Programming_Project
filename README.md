# Object Oriented Programming Project

Welcome to the **Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Project** hosted by `fahmizainal17`. This repository is dedicated to exploring and demonstrating the core concepts of Object Oriented Programming using Python. Whether you are new to OOP or looking to deepen your understanding, this project provides practical examples and notes on OOP principles, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## Project Overview

The Object Oriented Programming Project is a collection of Python scripts (`main.py`, `main2.py`) that serve as practical examples of OOP concepts applied in real-world scenarios. Each script contains annotated code explaining how OOP principles are implemented and can be used to solve complex problems in an organized and scalable manner.

## Repository Contents

- **`.gitignore`**: Configuration file to exclude certain files from Git version control.
- **`LICENSE`**: The project is licensed under the MIT License, allowing open-source use, modification, and distribution.
- **`README.md`**: Provides an introduction and guide to the repository.
- **`main.py` & `main2.py`**: Python files demonstrating various OOP concepts and practices.

## Key OOP Concepts Covered

- **Classes and Objects**: The basics of defining classes and creating objects, the fundamental building blocks of OOP.
- **Inheritance**: Demonstrates how new classes can inherit properties and methods from existing classes to promote code reusability.
- **Polymorphism**: Shows how objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass, with examples of method overriding.
- **Encapsulation**: Explains how to restrict access to methods and variables to prevent data from direct modification (private and protected members).
- **Abstraction**: Outlines how to create abstract classes that serve as blueprints for other classes, emphasizing the importance of defining a clear interface.

## Getting Started

To explore the OOP concepts demonstrated in this project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/fahmizainal17/Object_Oriented_Programming_Project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```
   cd Object_Oriented_Programming_Project
   ```

3. **Review the Python Scripts**: Open `main.py` and `main2.py` in your preferred IDE or text editor to study the implementations and annotations explaining the OOP concepts.

## How to Use This Project

- **Learning OOP**: Use the provided examples as a learning tool to understand how OOP principles can be applied in Python.
- **Reference Material**: Refer to the annotations and notes within the scripts when working on your own projects or when brushing up on OOP concepts.
- **Extending the Project**: Try adding new features or classes to the existing scripts or create new scripts that demonstrate other OOP principles not covered.
